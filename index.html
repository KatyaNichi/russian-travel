                    According to surveys, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country. Like, what haven’t we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can see all these beauties without millions in your account, a foreign passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who grabbed three children, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers around her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your holiday.

                             mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in your car, you can get acquainted with the invisible

                            The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in the summer. So you will see everything

                             eagles, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas' cats are also inhabitants of the Altai

                            Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is also an ideal place for skioring competitions.
                             This is a sport where the skier ties himself to a motorcycle and the tandem tries
                             develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the festival
